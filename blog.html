			<h3 id="aboutme">Joining a Web Development Immersive Program</h3>
			<h6>April 19, 2018</h6>
				<p class="aboutMeText">That's right, immersive program, not a bootcamp anymore as they were commonly called in previous years. It seems that bootcamps in general have received some bad press by those trying to get in on the trend, but lacking the dedication to properly educated their students. This has left some with a bad taste in their mouths in regards to bootcamp graduates. I guess you could say that any immersive programs still around and thriving must be the foundational ones to not have gone the way of the "bootcamps."</p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">I chose to attend General Assembly's immersive web development program after years of considering programming as a possible carrer choice. I was unsure if I would end up being an outnumbered minority, as a woman in tech, so I was a bit hesitant. I have found, that while I am a minority, it is not as big an issue as it might have been in years past.</p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">I have now been in the program for five and a half weeks and find that I love it. I have always really enjoyed making things, of any sort really, and this really satisfies that desire. I am learning so much, every day, that it can be tiring at times, but it is still so interesting and very much worth it. I am very happy to have finally found my home, a career path where I can be in a field that I love, doing work that doesn't even feel like work.</p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">I have been working nearly non-stop for the last few weeks and never get bored. I sometimes feel overwhelmed, but there are so many others in my class to help when I get stuck and they all feel just like I do. We have been provided innumerable resources so there is never a shortage of help, I am never alone with a problem. It is a great community environment that General Assembly provides for their students. I am very happy with my descision to take this step to help me break into a great industry.</p>

			<h3 id="aboutme">Work-Life Balance</h3>
			<h6>May 6, 2018</h6>
				<p class="aboutMeText">I hear the term "work-life balance" all over the place these days. According to some, millenials are ruining the work-life balance of the past by being too willing to work way past the typical 40 hour work week. As a student for the bulk of the last several years, I have certainly spent a lot more time working than enjoying life. Sometimes this is a neccessary sacrifice that we must make in order to be able to have the job security to take more "life" time later on. </p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">As I sit here on a Sunday night, taking my first break from homework for the weekend to do something I want to do, I can't help but wonder what life will feel like when I get that sought-after work-life balance. I certainly look forward to having weekends to enjoy life, but I might just end up being bored as well.</p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">The way that the economy is these days, we have to work hard to get what we want. I certainly don't place any blame for having to work as hard as I am to try to accomplish my goals. In fact, I feel that I will be that much more proud of myself once my goals are finally realized. Yeah, I have to put in a lot of hard work, but that is how we get places in life.</p>
				<p class="aboutMeText">I certainly think millenials have it right, work hard, work towards something, and maybe you will manage to acheive it. I don't think this is anything to look down upon and feel that the older generation should be proud of millenials for being able to do what it takes to have control over their own lives, I know I am.</p>
